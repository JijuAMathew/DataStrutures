/*Deque: A Comprehensive Overview
Introduction
A Deque (Double Ended Queue) is a versatile linear data structure that allows insertions and deletions at both its ends: the front and the rear. This flexibility distinguishes it from a regular queue, which only permits insertions at the rear and deletions at the front.

Types of Deques
Input-restricted deque: Allows insertions at only one end but permits deletions at both ends.
Output-restricted deque: Allows deletions at only one end but permits insertions at both ends.
Basic Operations
insertFront(data): Inserts an element at the front of the deque.
insertRear(data): Inserts an element at the rear of the deque.
deleteFront(): Removes and returns the element at the front of the deque.
deleteRear(): Removes and returns the element at the rear of the deque.
isFull(): Checks if the deque is full.
isEmpty(): Checks if the deque is empty.
peekFront(): Returns the value of the element at the front without removing it.
peekRear(): Returns the value of the element at the rear without removing it.
Applications
Stack and Queue implementation: By restricting operations, a deque can simulate both stacks and queues.
Job scheduling: Effectively manage and prioritize jobs.
Undo/Redo functionality: Store application states for undo and redo operations.
Sliding window problems: Find maximum or minimum elements in a sliding window.
Implementation using a Doubly Linked List
A doubly linked list is an ideal choice for implementing a deque due to its efficient support for insertions and deletions at both ends.*/
